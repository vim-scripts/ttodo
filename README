This plugin provides the |:Ttodo| command that allow easy filtering and viewing 
of todo.txt files (see http://todotxt.com) via |tlib#input#List()|. The plugin 
supports searching across multiple todo.txt files.

Examples: >
    " Show all tasks; default map (|g:ttodo_nmap|): <Leader>1
    :Ttodo

    " Show important tasks; default map (|g:ttodo_nmap_important|): <Leader>!
    :Ttodo!

    " Show tasks that are due in the next two weeks
    :Ttodo --due=2w

    " Show tasks with priorities A to C
    :Ttodo --pri=A-C

    " Show tasks matching @Test
    :Ttodo @Test

In order to use this plugin as a ftplugin, the vikitasks_vim plugin should be 
installed. Users might also want to set |g:ttodo_enable_ftdetect| to 1 in their 
|vimrc| file.

If filetype is ttodo, the following default keymaps are enabled:

    <cr> ................. Add a new task;
                           if either |g:ttodo#ftplugin#add_at_eof| is true or 
                           the map was invoked with a count, add the task at 
                           the end of file
    <c-cr> ............... Add a new task; copy any list and tags from the 
                           current task;
                           if either |g:ttodo#ftplugin#add_at_eof| is true or 
                           the map was invoked with a count, add the task at 
                           the end of file

If vikitasks_vim is installed (see |g:ttodo#use_vikitasks|), the following maps 
are available too:

    <LocalLeader>tx ...... Mark done
    <LocalLeader>td ...... Mark due in N days
    <LocalLeader>tw ...... Mark due in N weeks
    <LocalLeader>tm ...... Mark due in N months
    <LocalLeader>tp ...... Set priority
    <LocalLeader>ta ...... Archive done items
    <LocalLeader>tn ...... Add a note (the filename uses the first @list tag)

As a ftplugin, ttodo (in conjunction with vikitasks) supports the following 
syntax/extensions to todo.txt (see also 
https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format):

    (A) .............. A priority as upper case letter (at the beginning of the 
                       line)
    x DATE text ...... A completed task (with completion date)
    @list ............ list tag
    +keyword ......... keyword tag
    due:YYYY-MM-DD ... due dates
    rec:+Nx .......... When marking a task a done, add a new task with a due 
                       date in N d(ays), w(eeks), m(onths), y(ears); with the 
                       leading '+' use the original due date; else use the 
                       completion date (see also 
                       |g:vikitasks#ft#todotxt#copy_rec_items|)
    t:YYYY-MM-DD ..... Hide the tasks until the given date
    t:-Nd ............ Hide the tasks until N days before the due date
